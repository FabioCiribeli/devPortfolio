      <b>What I am:</b>

  </mat-card-header>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A multi-faceted developer (programs, webapps, serverless, you name it and we can talk)
    </li>
    <li>
      A systems administrator (I can do network stuff too!)
    </li>
    <li>
      Kind of anal about writing clean and maintable code (If your own staff can't work with my codebase I'm not happy
      with it yet)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>
      A graphic designer. Seriously, my art skills are subpar. I'll set up placeholder graphics for you, but other than
      that you need to supply the art.
    </li>
    <li>
      An Apple guy. I know Linux so I can use them, but I don't really touch Apple in my personal life.
    </li>
    <li>
      A data analyst. I can set up whatever piping you want, but someone else can analyze and make sense of it. I'll
      just get it where you need it to go.
    </li>
    <li>
      An on premesis worker. Due to reasons beyond my control, I am unable to work at any physical location other than
      my
      own office.
    </li>
